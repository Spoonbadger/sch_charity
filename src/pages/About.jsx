            Every year in Ethiopia hundreds of children are abandoned or orphaned. When this happens the prospects are bleak. With no welfare support thousands of children live on the streets and rely on begging to survive. One such child, abandoned at a few days old in a hospital in Addis Ababa, faced an uncertain future until a doctor desperate to find a home for the baby called us – ‘please help’ – and the work of Saltergate Children’s Home began. We called the baby Amanuel and he is now a lively little boy.

            SCH, Ethiopia is establishing secure, legally-based homes in Ethiopia where children are sheltered, clothed, fed and have access to medical facilities and a progressive education. Our homes provide a loving, caring environment founded on Christian principles, respect for culture and the strength of the family.

            The charity raises funds primarily in the UK and USA and the trustees, who have wide experience in education and business management in England and overseas, ensure that our constitution provides a robust framework for all that we do.

            Our close ties with communities and other charities in Ethiopia ensures that a supportive network is in place on the ground. In Addis Ababa we have an Operations Manager and Children’s Home Manager who oversee the work. Communication between the homes in Ethiopia and the trustees is regular and ongoing.
